(I already know how to do two's complement)
(Instead let's work on the homework)

# Two's Complement

- Most significant bit is the sign bit, when working with signed numbers. 
- Programmer chooses how to interpret it. 

What is the value of 10001010? 

As a signed number?

Take the minimum signed value for 8 bits:
`-(2^(n-1)) = -(2^7) = -128`

Add the other stuff
`0b1010 = 0xA = 10`

Result:
`-128 + 10 = -118`

As an unsigned number?

`10000000 = 2^7 = 128`


# Range of Signed / Unsigned number
